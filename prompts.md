This is actually a very useful thing to have:

A cli that can generate code based on predefined context and prompt.

This can then be ran automatically before pushing.

The cli or vscode extension can maybe be made in a way that it would not immediately overwrite, but show the difference with the previous version, and allow the user to press decline/accept.
