✅ Finish the apis pruneOpeanpi and summarizeOpenapi

✅ As a POC use the prompt made in prompts.json and generate the openapi with claude 3.5 manually, for now. If it's promising enough, put prompt schema on github (with claude key as auth?) **It's working**

✅ As a POC, Make a GPT that can find the operationIds you need, makes the pruned openapis, and writes typescript code based on a predefined convention. **Beautiful!**

✅ Edit https://chatgpt.com/gpts/editor/g-Gjix3kFre so it actually generates code with the pruned openapi

✅ Make a beautiful landing README at https://github.com/CodeFromAnywhere/Myelin
